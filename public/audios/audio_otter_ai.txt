Basketball is a sport loved by many,
[00:00:05.24]

[00:00:06.08]
but unfortunately,
[00:00:07.13]

[00:00:07.13]
it's not always a safe space for everyone.
[00:00:09.16]

[00:00:19.06]
Be.
[00:00:19.09]

[00:00:20.18]
It can make someone feel like they don't believe that everyone
[00:00:25.09]

[00:00:25.09]
deserves a chance to play basketball and be happy no matter who they are.
[00:00:29.19]

[00:00:35.10]
Basketball is not just a physical game.
[00:00:38.02]

[00:00:38.03]
It's a game of heart and passion,
[00:00:39.02]

[00:00:40.15]
and everyone deserves to experience the joy regardless of any challenges they may
[00:00:45.11]

[00:00:45.11]
face.
[00:00:45.24]

[00:00:51.10]
Let's use basketball to break down barriers,
[00:00:54.06]

[00:00:54.07]
promo inclusivity and diversity.
[00:00:56.06]

[00:00:57.14]
Better future for everyone.
[00:00:59.02]

[00:00:59.15]
We believe in making basketball a safe and inclusive sport for everyone.
[00:01:03.22]

[00:01:07.18]
Let's leave the and make sure that chance to play
[00:01:12.12]

[00:01:13.24]
join us in our movement to stop playing in basketball.
