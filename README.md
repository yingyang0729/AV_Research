## History

Accessibility Features:
To ensure that all users can access and enjoy the multimedia content in this application, I have implemented several accessibility features:

  
  1. High-Contrast Colors and Visual Hierarchy: I have designed the app with high-contrast colors and clear visual hierarchy, making it easier for people with visual impairments to navigate.
  
  2. Proper Tabbing Order: I have implemented a logical tabbing order, ensuring that keyboard users can navigate the app with ease.
  
  3. Aria Attributes: I have added Aria attributes to provide additional context for assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
  
  4. Screen Reader Compatibility: I have tested the app with various screen readers to ensure that all content is accessible.
  
  5. Closed Captioning: I have included closed captioning for the video to make it accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
  
  6. Audio Transcripts: I have provided transcripts for the audio to make it accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Technical Requirements:
To build and deliver the multimedia content in this application, I have used the following technical requirements:

  
  1. Node.js: I have used Node.js to build the server-side of the application.
  
  2. Express: I have used Express to handle routing and serve static files.
