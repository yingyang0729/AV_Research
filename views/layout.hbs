                <h3>A Thousand Years ( Lyrics )</h3>
                <p>
                  <br>
                  Heart beats fast. Colors and promises how to be brave?
                  <br>
                  How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
                  <br>
                  But watching you stand alone. All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow.
                  <br>
                  One step closer. I have died every day waiting for you.
                  <br>
                  Darling, don't be afraid. I have loved you for a thousand years.
                  <br>
                  I'll love you for a thousand more. Time stands still.
                  <br>
                  Beauty in all she is. I will be brave.
                  <br>
                  I will not let anything take away. What's standing in front of me.
                  <br>
                  Every breath, every hour has come to this. One step closer.
                  <br>
                  I have died every day waiting for you. Darling, don't be afraid.
                  <br>
                  I have loved you for a thousand years. I'll love you for a thousand more.
                  <br>
                  And all along I believed I would find you. Time has brought your heart to me.
                  <br>
                  I have loved you for a thousand years. I'll love you for a thousand more.
                  <br>
                  One step closer. One step closer. I have died every day waiting for you. 
                  <br>
                  Darling, don't be afraid. I have loved you for a thousand years. 
                  <br>
                  I'll love you for a thousand more. And all along I believed I would find you.
                  <br>
                  Time has brought your heart to me. I have loved you for a thousand years.
                  <br>
                  I'll love you for a thousand more.
