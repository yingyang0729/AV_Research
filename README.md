To build and run this project, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js
Express
A web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run npm install to install the project dependencies.
Run npm start to start the server.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
Accessibility Enhancements
To make the multimedia in this application accessible to everyone, I have implemented the following features:

Visual Contrast: I have used high-contrast colors and clear visual hierarchy to make it easier for people with visual impairments to navigate the app.
Tabbing: I have implemented proper tabbing order to make it easier for keyboard users to navigate the app.
Aria Attributes: I have added Aria attributes to provide additional context to assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
Screen Readers: I have tested the app with screen readers to ensure that all content is accessible.
Closed Captioning: I have included closed captioning for the video to make it accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
Transcripts: I have provided transcripts for the audio to make it accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
Technical Requirements
To deliver and implement the multimedia in this application, I have used the following technical requirements:

Node.js: I have used Node.js to build the server-side of the application.
Express: I have used Express to handle routing and serving the static files.
HTML5 Video and Audio Elements: I have used HTML5 video and audio elements to display the multimedia.
MediaElement.js: I have used MediaElement.js to enhance the multimedia controls and add support for closed captioning.
WebVTT: I have used WebVTT to provide closed captioning for the video.
JSON: I have used JSON to provide the transcript for the audio.


# Conclusion
This project has demonstrated how to create a fully accessible Node/Express media application using best practices for audio, video, and special needs. By implementing standard accessibility features and using the appropriate technical requirements, I have made the multimedia in this application accessible to everyone.
